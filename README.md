Scale Entropy Framework

The Scale Entropy Framework is a Python library designed for working with scale entropy, a concept that measures the complexity or disorder of a system across different scales. This framework provides tools for calculating scale entropy, visualizing scale-dependent data, and simulating processes that exhibit scale-invariant behavior, such as fractals.
Features

Calculate scale entropy for various types of data
Visualize scale-dependent phenomena using high-quality plots
Simulate fractal and scale-invariant processes
Modular design for easy extension and customization
